## Best Practices

### Configuration Best Practices

#### 1. Storage-Specific Tuning
- **S3**: Always enable batch API for maximum efficiency
- **GCS**: Tune worker count based on client pool size
- **Azure**: Use conservative worker counts to avoid throttling

#### 2. Batch Size Optimization
- **Small files (<1MB)**: Use larger batch sizes (1000+)
- **Large files (>100MB)**: Use smaller batch sizes (100-500)
- **Mixed sizes**: Use default batch size (1000)

#### 3. Worker Pool Sizing
- **CPU-bound operations**: Workers = CPU cores × 2
- **I/O-bound operations**: Workers = 20-50
- **Memory-constrained**: Workers = 5-10

#### 4. Error Handling Strategy
- **Production environments**: Use "continue" with low failure threshold
- **Development/testing**: Use "fail_fast" for quick feedback
- **Batch operations**: Use "retry_batch" for transient errors

### Operational Best Practices

#### 1. Monitoring and Alerting
```yaml
# Recommended monitoring metrics
- delete_operation_duration
- delete_success_rate
- delete_api_call_count
- delete_memory_usage_peak
- delete_cache_hit_rate
```

#### 2. Gradual Rollout
1. Start with small batch sizes and low worker counts
2. Monitor performance and error rates
3. Gradually increase batch sizes and worker counts
4. Set up alerting for degraded performance

#### 3. Testing Strategy
1. Test with representative data sets
2. Validate performance improvements
3. Test error handling scenarios
4. Verify memory usage patterns

#### 4. Capacity Planning
- Account for increased API throughput capacity needs
- Plan for reduced operation duration in scheduling
- Consider memory requirements for caching
- Factor in reduced storage costs from faster cleanup

### Performance Optimization

#### 1. Cache Configuration
```yaml
# Optimal cache settings
cache_enabled: true
cache_ttl: 30m              # Balance freshness vs efficiency
cache_max_size: 10000       # Adjust based on available memory
```

#### 2. Network Optimization
- Use same region/zone as storage backend
- Enable connection pooling
- Configure appropriate timeouts
- Use compression when available

#### 3. Error Recovery
```yaml
# Robust error handling
retry_attempts: 3
error_strategy: "continue"
failure_threshold: 0.05     # 5% failure tolerance
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Performance Lower Than Expected

**Symptoms**: Improvement factor < 5x

**Possible Causes**:
- Small batch sizes
- Low worker count
- Network latency
- Storage throttling

**Solutions**:
```yaml
# Increase batch size and workers
delete_optimizations:
  batch_size: 1000
  workers: 50
  
# Enable storage-specific optimizations
s3_optimizations:
  use_batch_api: true
```

#### 2. High Memory Usage

**Symptoms**: Memory usage grows with object count

**Possible Causes**:
- Large cache size
- Memory leaks in worker pools
- Inefficient batch processing

**Solutions**:
```yaml
# Reduce memory footprint
delete_optimizations:
  batch_size: 200
  workers: 10
  cache_enabled: false
```

#### 3. API Rate Limiting

**Symptoms**: High error rates, throttling errors

**Possible Causes**:
- Too many concurrent workers
- Aggressive batch processing
- Storage backend limits

**Solutions**:
```yaml
# Reduce concurrency
delete_optimizations:
  workers: 20               # Reduce from default
  batch_size: 500           # Smaller batches
  
azure_optimizations:
  max_workers: 10           # Conservative for Azure
```

#### 4. Inconsistent Performance

**Symptoms**: Variable operation times

**Possible Causes**:
- Network variability
- Storage backend load
- Ineffective caching

**Solutions**:
```yaml
# Improve consistency
delete_optimizations:
  retry_attempts: 5
  cache_enabled: true
  cache_ttl: 60m            # Longer cache retention
```
